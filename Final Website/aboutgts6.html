    <p class="textwrap">This is Fillip. His parents disapeared when he was the ripe old age of 7, heis currentlly 15 and trying to figure
        out life on his own. He is our main protagonist and the character we play as, we find him in his house and his
        village struggling. Will he get in trouble? It's up to you to find out.</p>
    <p>Fillip has salman colored hair and ocean blue eyes. He wears a tan bandana that used to be owned
        by his older brother, he still doesn't know what happened that day...nor wants to talk about it.</p>
    <p>He uses the rare dragon dagger that also used to be owned by his older brother. One day he found a power ring in
        his mother's old stuff...I guess she's an inventor or wizard.</p>
