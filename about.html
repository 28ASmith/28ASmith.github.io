    <h2>Hello there traveler!</h2>
    <p>I am currently in high school and I've created a game using RPG maker (which I now love and
        might use in the future to create more content) and I have made this very webssite.</p>
    <h2>More personal infomation (still going to leave stuff out)</h2>
    <p>I have four beutiful childen (cats) Three of whom I share with my parents. To learn more about them and see the
        bundles of joy themselves, click the link below.</p>
    <a href="Cats.html">THE ALL MIGHTY CATS</a>
    <p>I was born in spring of 2009, year of the Earth Ox for all you zodiac people. That make me soon to be 16. I am
        also curently writing a story (I might link it here in the fture) or at least trying to.This might be all I
        share, I don't want to share too much on the internet. </p>
    <p>Anyways...speaking of my game, what games do I like to play in my personal time? Well I recently started getting
        back into minecraft so I spent an un-healthy amount of time in minecraft. I also play a tone of roblox games,
        but I usually switch between roblox and minecraft after a few months.</p>
